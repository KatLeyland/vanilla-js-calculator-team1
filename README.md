# vanilla-js-calculator-team1
Created a calculator as a team then developed cypress test for it

Was a good practise for working as a team in a coding situation. It may not be the sleekest of code but it was truely a team effort!
This was also the first time we used Cypress in a project. I really enjoyed the challenge of finding ways to break our (not quite) finished product.

One of the biggest learning curves for me on this project was using github collaboratively, especially when deciding what code to keep when merging two different versions and merging them in a way that didn't break the whole thing!
